## Description

HvBot is a program that helps you to automate some actions when playing a well-known web game named __h*****v****__.

### Run with AriaTgBot

HvBot can be run independently. However, the most efficient approach to use is to use with AriaTgBot.

AriaTgBot can start HvBot by command, and inspect the running status including automatically start Arena or Random
Encounter battle, or start battle with different strategy.

### Attention

In addition, there are a lot of features to develop and some bugs to fix.

- HvBot will **fully control** your mouse, to stop it, move your mouse quickly to one of the 4 corners of your screen.

- Sometimes HvBot may crash, so run in **process mode** is preferable, rather than thread mode.
